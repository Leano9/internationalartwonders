	<p>This artwork shows a powerful portrait made with bold and messy brushstrokes. The figure looks strong and calm, as if sheâ€™s been painted with emotion instead of just colors. Her face is mostly in shadow, but soft highlights on her skin bring her to life.</p>
    
	<img src="images/image2.jpg" alt="Gallery Image 2">
	<p>This painting shows a graceful woman dressed in elegant, traditional clothing. She wears a patterned head wrap, a necklace, and long earrings that sparkle with detail. </p>
    
	<img src="images/image3.jpg" alt="Gallery Image 3">
	<p>This is a beautiful drawing of a deep red rose, made with colored pencils. At first glance, it almost looks like a photograph because of how realistic it is. The petals are rich in color, with highlights and shadows that give the flower depth and softness.</p>
    
	<img src="images/image4.jpg" alt="Gallery Image 4">
	<p>This painting features a close-up of a human eye surrounded by vibrant, textured brushstrokes. The eye is blue and highly detailed, with reflections and shadows that give it a realistic appearance.</p>

    <img src="images/image6.jpg" alt="Gallery Image 6">
	<p>The artist's intention in this painting seems to be to create a surreal and imaginative composition by blending human features with natural elements. </p>
